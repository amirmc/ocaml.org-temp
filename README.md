## Temporary sandbox for ocaml.org experimentation

Each of these folders is self-contained version of the ocaml.org site. They are not complete but they show different aspects of things we're working on.  You shouldn't try building anything from here as bits are likely to be (and remain) broken.

- *new-design*: examples of the new site design
- *markdown-site*: converting the existing site using `pandoc`
