OCaml jobs, 13 Jun 2013

Software Developer (Functional Programming)

Jane Street is looking to hire great software developers with an
interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional
programming with similarities to Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, F\# and SML,
is our language of choice. We’ve got the largest team of OCaml
developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world’s largest
OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting
everything from research to systems administration to trading systems.
If you’re interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in
the real world, there’s no better place.

The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on
education, and people learn about software and trading, both through
formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to
see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms.
Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get
involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly
competitive, and there’s a lot of room for growth.

[OCaml◎Scope : a new OCaml API search by names and
types](http://camlspotter.blogspot.com/2013/06/ocamlscope-new-ocaml-api-search-by.html) — Caml
Spotting 〈noreply(at)blogger.com (Jun Furuse)〉

, 06 Jun 2013The first public preview version of OCaml◎Scope is now
available at [http://oco.furuse.info/oco](http://oco.furuse.info/oco).\
\
It supports:\
\

-   Fast: on memory DB.
-   Friendly with OCamlFind packages: names are prefixed with the
    OCamlFind package name it belongs to. 
-   Friendly with OPAM: each OCamlFind package knows which OPAM package
    installed it.
-   Auto extraction of OCamlDoc comments.
-   Edit distance based path and type search.

Currently, the state of OCaml◎Scope is still at the proof-of-concept
level. Many things to be done, search result tweak, UI, tools, etc...
but so far, I am happy with its search speed and rather small memory
consumption. Currently it has nearly 150k entries (100 OCamlFind
packages including lablgtk, core, batteries, ocamlnet and eliom) takes
2secs maximum per search.\

[Flowing faster:
foundations](http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2013/06/04/flowing-faster-foundations) — Jamie
Brandon, 04 Jun 2013

I’ve spent the last few years using Gnome 2 and
[xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) on Ubuntu. Since both Ubuntu and the Gnome
foundation have dropped support for Gnome 2 I’m going to be forced to
upgrade sooner or later. Fortunately I have a two week holiday followed
by a new desktop at my new job, so now is a good time to break things on
my laptop.

Choices
=======

Almost all of my work happens in bash, emacs, firefox and xmonad. What
these have in common, to various extents, is what Mr Yegge likes to call
[living
software](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.html).
This breaks down the interaction barrier and allows them to grow beyond
point-and-grunt into an extension of my mind. This is what I look for in
any system I’m going to spend lots of time with.

[Unity](http://unity.ubuntu.com/) has the
[HUD](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/HUD) which is basically a CLI for
individual applications. There is plugin support [via
Compiz](http://wiki.compiz.org/Plugins%E2%80%8E) but nobody seems to be
writing any. It’s also incredibly closely tied to Ubuntu and despite all
the good they have done some of their recent decisions have been
worrying. Individually, they are each sensible and justified but taken
as a whole they make me a little nervous about investing heavily in
Unity. It’s a shame, because I would love to use the [Ubuntu
phone](http://www.ubuntu.com/phone).

[Gnome Shell](https://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell) is largely written in
js and is on its way to building a [healthy ecosystem of
extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/) (or will be, if it stops
breaking them every version bump). It even has an [almost-functional
repl](https://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/LookingGlass) which surely can
be shoe-horned into running
[cljs](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript). It’s missing the HUD
but most of the applications I use have their own CLI anyway. As proof
of its flexibility, it has acquired not one but three tiling window
managers:
[shelltile](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/657/shelltile/),
[shellshape](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/294/shellshape/) and
[gtile](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/28/gtile/). Of course,
all them were broken by the 3.8 update…

[KDE](http://www.kde.org/) has
[plasma](http://www.kde.org/workspaces/plasmadesktop/), which it uses
for … uh … desktop widgets. It also has
[activities](http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma#Activities) which are almost
a fantastic idea but it uses them to manage … desktop widgets. I don’t
remember the last time I saw my desktop. If I’m being unfair to KDE it
stems from frustration – they were way ahead of the game on
customisation and inter-application communication and they don’t seem to
have done anything *useful* with it.

There are also a million minimalist desktop environments but I prefer to
have most of my work done for me, so long as I have the power to
monkey-patch anything I disagree with. Vertical integration can be a
beautiful thing when it works.

So it looks like Gnome Shell wins. People complain that it is unusable
without extensions. For my purposes that is irrelevant. Most of my
favourite software is unusable without customisation (especially emacs).
What is important is the potential for sculpting it into something
better.

Experience
==========

The [Gnome Tweak Tool](https://live.gnome.org/GnomeTweakTool) is
absolutely essential. I have a few other extensions installed so far but
none are particularly essential. There are a few more I will have to
write myself.

I expected to find [Gnome Do](http://cooperteam.net/) indispensable. I
can’t quite puy my finger on the reason but I instead found it intensely
annoying and quickly uninstalled it. I think it’s an uncanny valley
thing – it’s *almost* a real repl. Adding panels to the
[Overview](http://media.bestofmicro.com/fedora-linux-gnome,M-M-329998-13.png)
might be a better option for me.

Most of my setup time was burned on remapping keys. Gnome doesn’t run
.xprofile or .Xmodmaprc and adding them to gnome-session doesn’t persist
the changes across suspend/hibernate. I spent a while trying to remap
keys [at the kernel
level](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Map_scancodes_to_keycodes)
before eventually realising that Gnome Tweak Tool has a keyboard
section. It doesn’t have all the options I want but it does mean I can
crib from their remapping code later.

Similarly, Gnome overrides the xorg.conf touchpad settings and its
settings dialog doesn’t provide an vertical-edge-scroll option.
Fortunately the setting still exists and can be set with dconf-editor
under `org/gnome/settings-daemon/touchpad`. Again, I’m leaning towards
configuring this in js in the future to keep all my changes in the same
place.

So far I’m impressed at the potential of Gnome Shell, if not the default
reality. The overview completion is fast and accurate. The notification
system is a big improvement over Gnome 2 (especially the on/off toggle).
The animations are smooth even on my integrated graphics. The ui and
icons are simple and clear. With the dark theme enabled the shell is
beautiful without getting in the way. Beauty is important in anything I
spend half my life staring at.

Bonus
=====

I also took the oppurtunuity to switch from
[Ubuntu](https://www.archlinux.org/) to
[Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/). Partly because of the nervousness I
mentioned earlier, but also because Ubuntu keeps fucking overwriting my
config files. I’ve given up touching anything beneath the surface
because every Ubuntu upgrade breaks everything. Arch seems to be more
kindly inclined towards tinkering and customisation and the wiki is a
fantastic resource for learning about linux internals. It has a
reputation for being unstable but since my new job will be developing in
Windows on a fancy desktop the risk of breakage on my laptop isn’t a big
deal. And it doesn’t overwrite my config files without asking.

The installation was straight-forward apart from a [known
mistake](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=162725) in this
months iso. My hardware all worked without any configuration. Suspend
and hibernate are faster and more reliable than they were in Ubuntu. My
battery life is slightly better. [Pacmatic](http://kmkeen.com/pacmatic/)
somewhat alleviates the fear of breakage. Installing proprietary
software (skype, spotify) has not been a problem. I did have to [tweak
the
fonts](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_Configuration#Infinality:_the_easy_way)
and I have still have some missing unicode characters in firefox which I
haven’t yet looked into.

Next
====

The next part of this series (which is due at some undetermined point in
the future) will probably be writing a hello-world style extension in
[cljs](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) as the first step
towards a document-centric tiling window manager.

Brandon, 02 Jun 2013

While we’re on the subject of backups – like most people, I rely pretty
heavily on cloud services. It sort of snuck up on me. I’m generally
trying to move towards using cloud services as dumb servers so I can
easily replace them. The first step is to be able to export and backup
all my data.

I considered using The Locker Project for backing up cloud services, but
it appears that Singly have pivoted from [‘control your own
data’](http://lockerproject.org/) to [‘give all your data to
us’](https://singly.com/product/). Back to the drawing board…

I use [OPML
Support](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/opml-support/)
and [Brief](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/brief/) to
replace google reader and
[Evolution](http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/) to back up google
mail, calendar and contacts. My address is on my own domain and managed
by google apps. I don’t yet use a local mail reader but Evolution looks
like a reasonable fallback if I have to drop gmail.

For music I use [Tomahawk](http://www.tomahawk-player.org/) with a
[Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com/) account as the main
resolver. I create playlists in Tomahawk using both the chart apis and
the [Echo Nest](http://echonest.com/) api and sync them to Spotify to
download to my phone. There’s still a little too much manual button
pressing in that process but it’s much easier than managing my own
collection. Both Tomahawk and Spotify mobile scrobble to my last.fm
account which I backup with
[lastexport](https://gitorious.org/fmthings/lasttolibre/blobs/master/lastexport.py).

Facebook is really the only service I couldn’t replace, due to a
combination of network effects and poor export tools. I use the builtin
export service but unfortunately it seems to be pretty hard to automate.
The only non-proprietary solution I could find was
[ArchiveFacebook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/archivefacebook/)
which I suppose could be run from the command line somehow. For now I
just set a monthly reminder in my calendar.

So now I have all my cloud data synced on my machine where the backup
tools from my last post can take care of it.
