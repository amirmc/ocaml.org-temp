Portability
===========

Supported platforms
-------------------

The bytecoded system currently runs on any POSIX-compliant operating
system with an ANSI-compliant C compiler (and tries hard to accommodate
deviations from POSIX and ANSI-C). It should run straight out of the box
on all Unix and Unix-compatible systems, including Linux and MacOS X.
(See below for MS Windows.) While not mandatory, it is recommended to
use the GNU gcc compiler to compile the distribution.

The native-code compiler currently supports the following
processor/operating system combinations:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Processors                                               Operating systems
  -------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------
  Tier 1 platforms\
   (actively used and maintained by the core Caml team):

  AMD64 (Intel and AMD x86 processors in 64-bit mode)      Linux, MacOS X

  IA32 (Intel and AMD x86 processors in 32-bit mode)       Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X, Microsoft Windows

  Power PC                                                 Linux, Mac OS X

  ARM                                                      Linux

  Tier 2 platforms\
   (maintained but less actively, with help from users):

  AMD64                                                    Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD

  IA32                                                     NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris 9

  PowerPC                                                  NetBSD

  SPARC                                                    Solaris 9, Linux, NetBSD
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other operating systems for the processors above have not been tested,
but the compiler may work under other operating systems with little
work.

Ports for Microsoft Windows
---------------------------

There are no less than four ports of Objective Caml for Microsoft
Windows available:

-   a native Win32 port, built with the
    [MinGW](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%0A%20%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/)
    development tools;
-   a native Win32 port, built with the Microsoft development tools
    (Microsoft Visual C++ and Microsoft Assembler);
-   a port consisting of the Unix sources compiled under the
    [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/) Unix-like environment for Windows.
-   a native Win64 (64-bit Windows) port, built with the Microsoft
    development tools (Microsoft Visual C++ and Microsoft Assembler);

Here is a summary of the main differences between these ports:

\* Cygwin-generated `.exe` files refer to a DLL that is distributed
under the GPL. Thus, these `.exe` files can only be distributed under a
license that is compatible with the GPL. Executables generated by MSVC
or by MinGW have no such restrictions.
